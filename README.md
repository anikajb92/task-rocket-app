### Code Examples



### Inspiration

I am a highly organized to-do list lover. This was an app that I fully customized to my needs and aesthetic likings. Building a project like this helps me understand a customer's needs because I am both the user and developer. There were many trials I went through to create the app that Task Rocket is today.
